gosa
===

A library for communicating with [SimpleX](https://simplex.chat/) Agents using Go.

**NOTE: THIS PROJECT IS VERY NEW. NEARLY NOTHING TO SEE HERE.**

# What is gosa exactly?

Writing bots for SimpleX currently means using Haskell. They make it quite easy to do so and they encourage you to check out the tooling they've provided. However, for those of us who like to explore with Go, I've created gosa.

SimpleX Agents run alongside Clients while taking care of a lot of the important security and protocol work so that clients don't have to.

Gosa makes it even simpler by providing a Go API for the Agent.
